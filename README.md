I feel I have made a fair amount of progress in this class. In the beginning, I really had no knowledge of web development and I have a fair understanding of backend development now. Though my goal is not to be a web developer, the knowledge of code and functionality will come in handy in many areas in IT. As far as this project, I thought it was an interesting task to redesign a website, but I feel I learned a lot. The only thing is, I wish there was more information on the actual ISUD website about the organization to glean for the project.
